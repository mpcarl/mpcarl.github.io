# API features and how to use them
## Available now
### Temporary, public access to objects
Swift and S3 each allow temporary, public access to objects without having to change the underlying ACLs on the object. Swift refers to this as a "TempURL" while S3 uses the term "pre-signed URLs." The following examples show how to give temporary public access to an object in Swift and an object in S3.

Swift CLI example, which displays the URL that can be used to access the object:
```shell
$ swift tempurl GET 600 /v1/CONTAINER/OBJECT_1 'KEY_ONE'
/v1/CONTAINER/OBJECT_1?temp_url_sig=735c8ee6c7c9fef88437f29d11ce3cf769a2565d&temp_url_expires=1495482380
```

S3 example:
```shell
$ aws --endpoint-url=https://{endpoint} s3 presign s3://bucket-1/new-file --expires-in 600
```

See [Pre-signed URLs][2] for additional details.


### Container/Bucket Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Swift and S3 provide the ability to control access to containers and buckets.

Basic Swift headers that can be set on containers:
* `X-Container-Read` makes the container publicly readable
* `X-Container-Write` makes the container publicly writeable
Both headers can be set for read & write access.

The Swift [ACLs][5] documentation provides complete documentation on using ACLs with Swift.

S3 customers can use the pre-made permissions via the `x-amz-acl` headers:
* `private`
* `public-read`
* `public-read-write`

Additional details on S3 permissions can be found in the [API reference][6] documentation.



### Versioning
Swift and S3 support versioning of objects, though there are a few differences

####  S3 versioning

- All versions kept in the same bucket
- Delete leaves a "delete marker" -- simple GET does not restore
- A version can be deleted with the ID
- All objects have a version ID as part of their MD -- null by default

####  Swift versioning

- Versions copied to a separate versions location container when overwritten on PUT
- Older versions renames to have a prefix of the length of the object name and suffix of /<creation time>
- Delete restores prior version by copying back and permanently deletes current version -- big semantic difference
- Need to delete all versions -- no easy way to delete all versions


####  Common

- Set at bucket level
- Older versions can be returned by specific request for a version (but URI will differ)


## Future functions

### Content Distribution Network (CDN)
Swift containers can be exposed via the Softlayer CDN network using the following command:
```shell
$ curl -X PUT 'https://endpoint/v1/ACCOUNT/CONTAINER' -H "X-Auth-Token: <token>" -H "X-Container-Read: .r:*" -H "*X-Context: cdn"
```
See [Swift CDN support][3] and [CDN][7] for more details.

***CDN is not currently available in S3.***
